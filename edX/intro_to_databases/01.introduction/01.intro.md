# Introduction to Databases

## Database Management System

It provides an efficient, reliable, convinient, and safe multi-user storage of and access to massive amounts of persistent data.

- Massive
  - Terabytes of data (sometimes everyday)
  - much larger than the data that can be fit in memory
- Persistent
  - data outlives the program executing on it
- Safe
  - Gurantees consistency of data handled by databases
- multi-user
  - using concurrency control on data items
- convienient
  - physical data independence, i.e., program should not care about how the data is laid out
  - high-level query language
    - declarative - describe what you want
- efficient
  - thousands query/updates per second
- reliable
  - 99.99999..% uptime

Database applications may be programmed via "frameworks", like Django, RubyOnRails, etc.  
These may run in conjunction with "middleware"  
Data-intensive applications may not use DBMS at all.  

## Key Concepts

- Data Model
  - Description of how the data is structured
  - relational data model
    - set of records
  - xml document
  - graph
    - nodes, edges
- Schema versus data
  - schema 
    - set strucutre of database
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - setup schema or structure
- Data manipulation or query language (DML)
