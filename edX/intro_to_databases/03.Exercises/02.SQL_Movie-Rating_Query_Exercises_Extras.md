# SQL Movie-Rating Query Exercises Extras

## Query 1

Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind.

```sql
select name
from Reviewer
where rID in (
    select rID
    from Rating natural join Movie
    where title = "Gone with the Wind"
);
```

## Query 2

For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

```sql
select name, title, stars
from (Movie join Rating using (mID)) join Reviewer using (rID)
where director = name;
```

## Query 3

Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. (Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".)

```sql
select *
from (
    select name as s from Reviewer
    union
    select title as s from Movie
)
order by s;
```

## Query 4

Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson.

```sql
select title
from Movie
where mID not in (
    select mID
    from Rating
        natural join Reviewer
    where name="Chris Jackson"
)
```

## Query 5

For all pairs of reviewers such that both reviewers gave a rating to the same movie, return the names of both reviewers. Eliminate duplicates, don't pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once. For each pair, return the names in the pair in alphabetical order.

```sql
select distinct r1.name, r2.name
from (Reviewer natural join Rating) r1,
        (Reviewer natural join Rating) r2
where r1.mID = r2.mID
    and r1.name < r2.name
order by r2.name, r1.name;
```

## Query 6

For each rating that is the lowest (fewest stars) currently in the database, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

```sql
select name, title, stars
from Movie natural join Rating natural join Reviewer
where stars = (
    select min(stars) from Rating
);
```

## Query 7

List movie titles and average ratings, from highest-rated to lowest-rated. If two or more movies have the same average rating, list them in alphabetical order.

```sql
select title, avg(stars)
from Movie natural join Rating
group by mID
order by avg(stars) desc,
            title;
```

## Question 8

Find the names of all reviewers who have contributed three or more ratings. (As an extra challenge, try writing the query without HAVING or without COUNT.)

```sql
select name
from Rating natural join Reviewer
group by rID
having count(rID) >= 3;

-- Without having
select name
from (
    select rID, count(*) r_count
    from Rating
    group by rID
) R natural join Reviewer
where R.r_count >= 3;

-- Without Count
select name
from Reviewer
where rID in (
    select rID
    from (
            Rating r1
            join Rating r2
            using (rID)
        ) join Rating r3
        using (rID)
    where (
            r1.ratingDate <> r2.ratingDate
            and r2.ratingDate <> r3.ratingDate
            and r3.ratingDate <> r1.ratingDate
        ) OR (
            r1.ratingDate <> r2.ratingDate
            and r3.ratingDate is null
    )
);
```

## Question 9

Some directors directed more than one movie. For all such directors, return the titles of all movies directed by them, along with the director name. Sort by director name, then movie title. (As an extra challenge, try writing the query both with and without COUNT.)

```sql
select title, director
from Movie
where director in (
    select director
    from Movie
    group by director
    having count(director) >= 2
)
order by director, title;

-- without count
select m1.title, director
from Movie m1 join Movie m2 using(director)
where m1.mID <> m2.mID
order by director, m1.title;
```

## Question 10

Find the movie(s) with the highest average rating. Return the movie title(s) and average rating. (Hint: This query is more difficult to write in SQLite than other systems; you might think of it as finding the highest average rating and then choosing the movie(s) with that average rating.)

```sql
select title, avg(stars)
from Rating natural join Movie
group by mID
having avg(stars) = (
    select max(star_avg)
    from (
        select mID, avg(stars) star_avg
        from Rating
        group by mID
    )
);
```

## Question 11

Find the movie(s) with the lowest average rating. Return the movie title(s) and average rating. (Hint: This query may be more difficult to write in SQLite than other systems; you might think of it as finding the lowest average rating and then choosing the movie(s) with that average rating.)

```sql
select title, avg(stars)
from Rating natural join Movie
group by mID
having avg(stars) = (
    select min(avg_s)
    from (
        select mID, avg(stars) avg_s
        from Rating
        group by mID
    )
);
```

## Question 12

For each director, return the director's name together with the title(s) of the movie(s) they directed that received the highest rating among all of their movies, and the value of that rating. Ignore movies whose director is NULL.

```sql
select distinct director, title, stars
from (
    select director, stars
    from Rating natural join Movie
    group by director
    having stars = max(stars)
) d natural join Movie natural join Rating r;
```
