# SQL Social-Network Modification Exercises

## Query 1

It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler.

```sql
delete from Highschooler
where grade = 12;
```

## Query 2

If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple.

```sql
delete from Likes
where ID2 not in (
        select ID1
        from Likes l1
        where l1.ID2 = Likes.ID1
    ) and ID2 in (
        select ID2
        from Friend f
        where f.ID1 = Likes.ID1 and f.ID2 = Likes.ID2
    );
```

## Query 3

For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. (This one is a bit challenging; congratulations if you get it right.)

```sql

insert into Friend
-- Select Query
select distinct f1.ID1, f2.ID2
from Friend f1
    join Friend f2
    on f1.ID2 = f2.ID1
where f1.ID1 <> f2.ID2 -- make (f1.ID1, f2.ID2) as friends
    and f1.ID1 not in (
        select f3.ID1
        from Friend f3
        where  f3.ID2 = f2.ID2
    )
```
