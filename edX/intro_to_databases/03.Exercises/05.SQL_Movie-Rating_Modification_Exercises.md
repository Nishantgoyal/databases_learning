# SQL Movie-Rating Modification Exercises

## Query 1

Add the reviewer Roger Ebert to your database, with an rID of 209.

```sql
insert into Reviewer values (209, "Roger Ebert");
```

## Query 2

For all movies that have an average rating of 4 stars or higher, add 25 to the release year. (Update the existing tuples; don't insert new tuples.)

```sql
update Movie
set year = year + 25
where mID in (
    select mID
    from Movie m natural join Rating r
    group by mID
    having avg(stars) >= 4
);
```

## Query 3

Remove all ratings where the movie's year is before 1970 or after 2000, and the rating is fewer than 4 stars.

```sql
delete from Rating
where mID in (
        select mID
        from Movie
        where year < 1970 or year > 2000
    ) and stars < 4;
```
