# SQL Social-Network Query Exercises

Students at your hometown high school have decided to organize their social network using databases. So far, they have collected information about sixteen students in four grades, 9-12.

## Schema

- `Highschooler ( ID, name, grade )`
- `Friend ( ID1, ID2 )`
- `Likes ( ID1, ID2 )`

## Query 1

Find the names of all students who are friends with someone named Gabriel.

```sql
select h1.name
from (Highschooler h1 join Friend F on h1.ID = F.ID1) join Highschooler h2 on h2.ID = F.ID2
where h2.name = "Gabriel";
```

## Query 2

For every student who likes someone 2 or more grades younger than themselves, return that student's name and grade, and the name and grade of the student they like.

```sql
select h1.name, h1.grade, h2.name, h2.grade
from (Highschooler h1 join Likes L on h1.ID = L.ID1) join Highschooler h2 on h2.ID = L.ID2
where h1.grade - h2.grade >= 2;
```

## Query 3

For every pair of students who both like each other, return the name and grade of both students. Include each pair only once, with the two names in alphabetical order.

```sql
select L1.name, L1.grade, L2.name, L2.grade
from (
        Highschooler join Likes on Highschooler.ID = Likes.ID1
    ) L1, (
        Highschooler join Likes on Highschooler.ID = Likes.ID1
    ) L2
where L1.ID1 = L2.ID2
    and L1.ID2 = L2.ID1
    and L1.name < L2.name;
```

## Query 4

Find all students who do not appear in the Likes table (as a student who likes or is liked) and return their names and grades. Sort by grade, then by name within each grade.

```sql
select name, grade
from Highschooler
where ID not in (
    select ID1 from Likes
    union
    select ID2 from Likes
)
order by grade, name;
```

## Question 5

For every situation where student A likes student B, but we have no information about whom B likes (that is, B does not appear as an ID1 in the Likes table), return A and B's names and grades.

```sql
select h1.name, h1.grade, h2.name, h2.grade
from (
        Highschooler h1 join Likes l on h1.ID = l.ID1
    ) join Highschooler h2 on h2.ID = l.ID2
where l.ID2 not in (
    select ID1
    from Likes
);
```

## Question 6

Find names and grades of students who only have friends in the same grade. Return the result sorted by grade, then by name within each grade.

```sql
select name, grade
from Highschooler
where ID not in (
    select h1.ID
    from (
        Highschooler h1
        join friend f
        on h1.ID = f.ID1
    ) join Highschooler h2
        on f.ID2 = h2.ID
    where h1.grade <> h2.grade
)
order by grade, name
```

## Question 7

For each student A who likes a student B where the two are not friends, find if they have a friend C in common (who can introduce them!). For all such trios, return the name and grade of A, B, and C.

```sql
select h1.name, h1.grade, h3.name, h3.grade, h2.name, h2.grade
from Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2, Highschooler h3, (
      select diff.ID1 ID1, f1.ID2 ID2, diff.ID2 ID3
      from Friend f1, (
          select *
          from Likes
          except
          select *
          from Friend ) diff,
          Friend f2
      where diff.ID1 = f1.ID1
          and f1.ID2 = f2.ID1
          and f2.ID2 = diff.ID2
    ) c
where h1.ID = c.ID1
    and h2.ID = c.ID2
    and h3.ID = c.ID3
```

## Question 8

Find the difference between the number of students in the school and the number of different first names.

```sql
select school_count - name_count
from (
        select count(ID) school_count
        from Highschooler
    ), (
        select count(distinct name) name_count
        from Highschooler
    )
```

## Question 9

Find the name and grade of all students who are liked by more than one other student.

```sql
```
