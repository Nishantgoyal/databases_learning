# SQL Joins

- Tables in FROM clause forms `Cross-Product` of tables

## Inner Join on condition

```sql
select distinct col_1, col_2, ...
from table_1 inner join table_2 -- keyword inner is optional
-- from table_1 join table_2 -- alternative
on table_1.id = table_2.id
```

## Natural Join
  
Automatically takes the common attributes between the tables, and check for equality.  
It also eliminates the duplicate column names which are equated, removing ambiguity.  

```sql
select distinct col_1, col_2, ...
from table_1 natural join table_2
```

## Inner Join Using(attrs)

We can use the `using` clause to specify the attributes that need to be equated explicitely.  
The keywords `on` and `using` cannot be simaltaneously used while performing the join.

```sql
select distinct col_1, col_2, ...
from table_1 join table_2 using(attr)
```

## Left | Right | Full Outer Join

- `LEFT`: Takes any tuple on the left side, and if there is no right match, it appends a NULL value.
- ...

```sql
select distinct col_1, col_2, ...
from table_1 left outer join table_2 using(attr);
```
