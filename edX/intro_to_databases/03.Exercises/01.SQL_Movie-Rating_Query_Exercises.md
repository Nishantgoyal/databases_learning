# SQL Movie-Rating Query Exercises

You've started a new `movie-rating website`, and you've been collecting data on reviewers' ratings of various movies. There's not much data yet, but you can still try out some interesting queries.

## Schema

- `Movie ( mID, title, year, director )`
- `Reviewer ( rID, name )`
- `Rating ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate )`

## Query 1

Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg.

```sql
select title
from Movie
where director="Steven Spielberg";
```

## Query 2

Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.

```sql
select distinct year
from Movie join Rating using(mID)
where stars = 4 or stars = 5
order by year;
```

## Query 3

Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings.

```sql
select title
from Movie
where mID not in (select mID from Rating);
```

## Query 4

Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date.

```sql
select name
from Reviewer join Rating using(rID)
where ratingDate is null;
```

## Query 5

Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars.

```sql
select name, title, stars, ratingDate
from Movie natural join Reviewer natural join Rating
order by name, title, stars;
```

## Query 6

For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie.

```sql
select name, title
from (
    select r1.rID, r1.mID
    from Rating r1, Rating r2
    where r1.rID = r2.rID
        and r1.mID = r2.mID
        and r1.stars > r2.stars
        and r1.ratingDate > r2.ratingDate) as r natural join Movie natural join Reviewer;
```

## Query 7

For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. Return the movie title and number of stars. Sort by movie title.

```sql
select title, max(stars)
from Movie join Rating using(mID)
group by mID
order by title;
```

## Query 8

For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title.

```sql
select title, (max_star - min_star) as "rating spread"
from (
    select mID, max(stars) max_star from Rating
    group by mID
) as max_stars natural join (
    select mID, min(stars) min_star from Rating
    group by mID
) as min_stars natural join Movie
order by (max_star - min_star) desc, title;
```

## Query 9

Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.)

```sql
select (
    select avg(avg_star) as bef_1980
    from (
        select mID, title, avg(stars) avg_star
        from Movie join Rating using(mID)
        where year < 1980
        group by title
    )
) - (
    select avg(avg_star) as bef_1980
    from (
        select mID, title, avg(stars) avg_star
        from Movie join Rating using(mID)
        where year > 1980
        group by title
    )
) ;
```
