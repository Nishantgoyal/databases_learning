# The Relational Model

- Database = set of named `relations` (or `tables`)
- Each relation has a set of named `attributes` (or `columns`)
- Each `tuple` (or `row`) has a value for each attribute
- Each attribute has a `type` (or `domain`)
  - `NULL` - special value for `"unknown"` or `"undefined"`
- `Schema:` structural description of relations in database
- `Instance:` actual content at given point in time
- `Key:` attribute whose value is unique in each tuple, or set of attributes whose combined values are unique

```sql
Create Table Student(ID, student_Name, GPA, photo)
-- with type of attributes
Create Table College(college_name varchar, college_state char(2), enrollment integer)
```
