# SQL Social-Network Query Exercises

## Query 1

For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C.

```sql
select h1.name, h1.grade, h2.name, h2.grade, h3.name, h3.grade
from Highschooler h1
    join Likes l1 on h1.ID = l1.ID1
    join Highschooler h2 on h2.ID = l1.ID2,
    Likes l2 join Highschooler h3 on h3.ID = l2.ID2
where l1.ID2 = l2.ID1
    and l2.ID2 <> l1.ID1;
```

## Query 2

Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades.

```sql
select name, grade
from Highschooler
where ID not in (
    select h1.ID
    from Highschooler h1
        join Friend f1 on h1.ID = f1.ID1
        join Highschooler h2 on h2.ID = f1.ID2
    where h1.grade = h2.grade
);
```

## Query 3

What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.)

```sql
select avg(friend_count)
from (
    select ID1, count(ID2) friend_count
    from Friend
    group by ID1
);
```

## Query 4

Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend.

```sql
select count(f2.ID2)
from Highschooler h2
    join Friend f2 on h2.ID = f2.ID1
    join Highschooler h3 on h3.ID = f2.ID2
where (
        f2.ID1 in (
            select f1.ID2 -- Cassandra_friends
            from Highschooler h1
                join Friend f1 on h1.ID = f1.ID1
            where h1.name = "Cassandra"
        ) and h3.name <> "Cassandra"
    ) or (
        h2.name == "Cassandra"
    );
```

## Query 5
